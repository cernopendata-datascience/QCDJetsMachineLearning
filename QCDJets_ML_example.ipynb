    "\n",
    "The machine learning example we present here is the classification of jets originating either from gluons or the three of the lightest quarks (_up_, _down_ and _strange_). This is an important task, since on the observable macroscopic level the two types of jets look very similar, but from a physical point of view the difference between them is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jets are present in practically every interesting high energy proton-proton collision event. Protons themselves are composite particles made up of three quarks (two _up_ quarks and one _down_ quark), which are bound together by gluons. These color-charged quarks and gluons are collectively known as partons. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of strong interaction and describes how color-charged particles behave. As the protons collide, the transfer of momentum causes the interacting partons to accelerate in directions perpendicular to the colliding proton beams. The accelerating partons radiate gluons, which can split into quark-antiquark pairs or radiate even more gluons. This chain reaction produces a shower of partons and they eventually form observable hadrons in a cone-shaped cascade, called a jet. The partons can interact in various interesting ways in the proton-proton collision and to understand these interaction processes, we need to be able to accurately classify the observed jets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since only the hadron-level information of a jet is available to us, we must infer the initiating parton of a jet from certain observable properties. Traditionally in the CMS collaboration, the task of identifying quark and gluon jets has been done by building a likelihood-based discriminator from three theoretically-motivated variables (see the public physics analysis summary _CMS-PAS-JME-13-002_ for more detailed information).\n",

    "__Jet multiplicity__ is the number of particles contained in the jet (subject to certain constraints on the properties of the particles, see _CMS-PAS-JME-13-002_ again). Gluons are expected to radiate more intensely, so on average gluon jets contain more particles.\n",

It describes how the total transverse momentum of a jet is distributed to its constituents. Quark jets are expected to have fewer constituents carrying the majority of the jet's momentum, which means that the value of $p_T D$ is on average larger for quark jets.\n",

The likelihood-product discriminator is a very simple approach, but also relatively robust and reliable.

Let's see how it looks."

The true strength of utilizing deep neural networks for this task was not demonstrated here, as it lies in the neural networks' ability of finding more subtle differences between the two types of jets in lower level features. Hence, by incorporating more information on e.g. the particle-level, we could build an even better DNN jet classifier.
